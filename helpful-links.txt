I posted this:

    Section "Device"
    # WaveShare SpotPear 3.5", framebuffer 1
    Identifier "uga"
    driver "fbdev"
    Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
    Option "ShadowFB" "off"
    EndSection

    Section "Monitor"
    # Primary monitor. WaveShare SpotPear 480x320
    Identifier "WSSP"
    EndSection

    Section "Screen"
    Identifier "primary"
    Device "uga"
    Monitor "WSSP"
    EndSection

    Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "default"
    Screen 0 "primary" 0 0
    EndSection 

to the existing xorg config /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf and run sudo startx. Then the desktop environment was loaded on touchdisplay. Touch works too.
